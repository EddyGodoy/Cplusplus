# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project the main focus was to write a program that could take user input and produce the results of their ivestments with and without monthly deposits. It was meant to be able to calculate such figures with user implemented annual interest and for the amount of years the user decided as well. It also had to have a full starting menu that accepted input as well as corrected and declined imporper inputs while then displaying the information into two separate tables one with the monthly deposits and onbe without. 

# What did you do particularly well?
Although I could have gone for a bit more creativity i was actually very proud of having been able to code the table to look like the one in the example. I did really well in being able to calculate the proper amounts and also being able to then display and organize that information back to the user in a clear and easy to understand way. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One of my initial thoughts on this was putting more effort into my input validation. That would benefit my code massively because I could make sure that my code was being used properly as well as making it more reliable to the user in case of accidentaly inputting improper or unreal values and making them start from where they left off as opposed to running the entire code again. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For this code in particular I kind of struggled with the proper organization of my values within my table as at times they would not really correlate well with one another as my values grew. One way i managed to solve this was using my setprecision to certain values which then kept my code much more well organized as oppesed to relying on just indenting.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think all aspects of this code are helpful for future assignments or even projects as i need to be able to take user input and then use that very input to the run through my code and manipulate it to give me the proper results that i should be outputting. This helped me a lot on both being able to work with input and also displaying stuff neatly and properly as maybe a more advanced program would just in a much simpler and smaller scale. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Honestly, i just tried to keep this program as simple and to the point as i could. At first i was really struggling and felt i was overthinking the whole thing so i stuck with just creating my menu and its layout while taking input from the user as well as then having my formula which would calculate my values based in what was inputted and then just creating the layout of my two tables which was properly layed it with the values that my previous formula had created. Realistically i could have made it way more coplex and probably way more effective but i tried to keep things simple and not overcomplicate it which made my code also very easy to understand and probably easy to go back and customize.
